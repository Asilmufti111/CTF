# Cryptography 
 `Code`
 - If the code has uppercase and lowercase letter & end by (=) sign --> It is maybe base-64 code --> it also can have + and /
 - In base-64 --> the = sign is always added to the end of the string (if it's length doesn't divided by 4)
 - A website to count the length of the string --> https://www.lettercount.com/ 
-	`Decode base64 code by python `
-	Classic cypher ---> commonly means rot 13 (Caesar's Cipher)..
-	32 chars ---> md5 hash (one of the guesses)
-	Base 32 doesn't has capital letters in it..
